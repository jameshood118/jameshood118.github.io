# Portfolio-Vue

## History

A long time ago, I made a portfolio, I was young and stupid, I was given an assignment in my Sophmore Digital Portfolio class at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh (online) to create one. I didnt quite understand everything that was going on, and didnt realize for some reason, that the entire project of the 5.5 weeks was the portfolio, I thought it was just the first assignment. I worked on that thing for many many many hours, (in flash, actionscript 2.0), then turned it in that friday. My teacher was shocked that I had a finished portfolio, when the assignment was only to spec out what it might be about. Everyone else read and understood the directions better than i did.

Several years later I replaced that portfolio with others, using different technologies. I started with a simple html site, then migrated into a php dynamic driven website, then I took it down several times and updated it. I updated it 2 years ago (while i was working on Chicos) and converted it over to bootstrap. Sometime after that I started noticing more people using git repos as their portfolios and only using a slimmed down site as their calling card (so to speak). I switched over to this and worked on converting a tumblr blog over to a working portfolio while updating my github and codepen with various projects I have worked on. This brings us to now, for the last 6 months I have been working with VueJS and I have decided to start working on a new portfolio, written in VueJS 2.0 (webpack, with bulma as the css framework). I am not a designer, im a developer.

## Purpose

Stand up a repo, using more narrowly focused technologies, those technologies being the ones I truly feel passionate about and want to focus on.
